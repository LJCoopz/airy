# Airy docs

This directory contains the [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site that serves the docs for [docs.airy.co](https://docs.airy.co)

Documentation is stored in Markdown files in the `content/` folder. If you want to make changes to the theme, you have to run `npm run build` in `themes/hugo-geekdoc` before committing so that Netlify has the static assets needed to build the page.
